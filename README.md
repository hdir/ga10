# Helsedirektoratet - GÃ¥ 10

## About

An app for Android and iOS for helping people get motivated to walk at least 10 minutes of brisk walk a day.
Collects data on average walking speed per minute from native APIs

- Android - [Google Fit Sdk](https://developers.google.com/fit/)
- iOS - [Pedometer](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coremotion/cmpedometer)

## Requirements

The project requires that you have the following tools installed:

- [Visual Studio IDE 2019](http://visualstudio.com/) (with the following)
  - [Xamarin](https://docs.xamarin.com)

## Set up project

1. Open [the solution file](helsedirektoratet-bare-10-2018.sln)
2. Restore nuget packages for solution

## Notes

You should probably use actual devices rather than emulators to run the project, as you need proper walking data collected by the phone sensors.

### Public release

This is a public release of the source code, which has the following information and assets removed:

- App icons
- Image and animation assets
- API keys
- Certificates and provisioning profiles

### Platform specific services

There are two services which are platform specific: namely the ones implementing

[IWalkingDataService.cs](Bare10/Bare10/Services/Interfaces/IWalkingDataService.cs)

and

[IUpdateService.cs](Bare10/Bare10/Services/Interfaces/IUpdateService.cs)

These are loaded via lazy-loading in the following classes respectively (in the PCL)

[CrossWalkingDataService.cs](Bare10/Bare10/Services/Interfaces/CrossWalkingDataService.cs)

[CrossUpdateService.cs](Bare10/Bare10/Services/Interfaces/CrossUpdateService.cs)

These two files are added with link (by reference) to the Platform specific projects.

To make sure that the compiler does not optimize away the platform specific Service implementations, a [CrossServiceContainer](Bare10/Bare10/CrossServiceContainer.cs) class
has been created which contains the references. These are set at runtime at the earliest convenient time in the [iOS Appdelegate](Bare10/Bare10.iOS/AppDelegate.cs) and [Android MainActivity](Bare10/Bare10.Android/MainActivity.cs).
These are also set for the [Android UpdateJob](Bare10/Bare10.Android/Background/UpdateJob.cs) and the `PerformFetch()` method (for background polls) in the [iOS Appdelegate](Bare10/Bare10.iOS/AppDelegate.cs).

### Analytics

Analytics has been implemented for this app for tracking events. These include both data and UI events

### Crash reports and diagnostics

Crash reports and diagnostics have been implemented for this app, and all crashes should deliver a stack trace (where possible)
